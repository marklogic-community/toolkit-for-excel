The sample applications in this directory are here to help you, the curious 
developer, learn the ins and outs of some of the more advanced features of 
MarkLogic Server 4.0 and to give you starting points for building your own 
master works.
 
With that in mind, we are giving you the freedom to use this code as you 
please while working with MarkLogic Server.  There are, however, a few rules 
of the road that you need to be aware of.
 
First, the good bits (you’ll like these):

1) You are free to modify the sample code.  We mean it: extend, embed, reuse.

2) You are free to redistribute the sample code (and anything you build using 
all or parts of it) subject to this agreement.  Again, we mean it.  Go for it.

3) You are free to use the sample code for development, training, promotional,
or production purposes.  Any reasonable use of the sample source code, subject 
to this agreement, is acceptable.

Now, all that being said, there are a few restrictions:
 
1) The samples can only be used in conjunction with MarkLogic Server.  This 
means that you can use this sample source code in any manner you like, as 
long as that manner involves connecting to an instance of MarkLogic Server. 
For example, you can modify the heatmaps Flash interface to work with 
different data, or to have a different interface, or to display grinning 
monkeys, but you cannot use the heatmaps Flash interface (or any modified 
version of it) as a front end to your own custom server technology that you 
whipped up in your spare time.
 
2) If you choose to redistribute the sample code or something you built 
using it, you need to reproduce any legal notices (copyright, etc.) the 
code contains, and you need to protect the code with terms at least as 
stringent as these.

3) The samples and sample source code are not supported by Mark Logic. 
In general, if we know there’s a bug, we’re probably going to want to fix 
it -- but you shouldn’t expect the same level of service for these samples 
that you get for the server itself under your support contract.  If you run 
into a problem while working with the samples and believe there is an 
underlying issue with MarkLogic Server, please be sure to let us know 
through your normal support contact.  However, if it turns out that the 
problem resides in the sample code, we cannot commit to resolving it. 
This also means that we’re not committing to deliver updates or bug fixes 
to the sample source code.

4) Our liability?  None.  We disclaim it all, every last bit of it. 
Indemnification?  Same deal -- you’re on your own.  If that’s a problem 
for you, then please don’t use any of this sample code. 
 
5) Some of the files, such as the Flash Common Libraries, are governed by 
their own Licenses.  We have tried hard to make sure those Licenses don’t 
limit our intent for these sample applications.  Nonetheless, in cases where 
there is a file-specific License, that License supersedes this agreement.
 
Isn’t it amazing how the good parts are really easy to explain, while the 
not-so-good parts take five lines each?  Thanks for reading this far.  We 
hope that you think this is a pretty good deal, and a great way to get 
revved up on some of the new features in MarkLogic Server 4.0.  If you’re 
okay with all of the above, go right ahead and dig in. 

Happy Coding!
The MarkLogic Team
